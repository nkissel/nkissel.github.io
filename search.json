    "text": "Nicholas Kissel  nkissel@andrew.cmu.edu\n\n\n\nHi! I recently defended my PhD thesis in the Department of Statistics & Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University. I am primarily interested in developing methods for generating model confidence sets. More broadly, I am interested in creating inferential procedures for machine learning modeling methods, as well as developing accessible statistical tools that are applicable to natural and social science research.\nMy thesis was advised by Jing Lei. It explores model confidence set procedures and builds upon my undergraduate work with Lucas Mentch. Outside of my methodological and theoretical work, I also collaborate with some faculty in Pitt’s Department of Psychiatry on sleep and depression research."
