Hi! I am a first year PhD student in the [Department of Statistics & Data Science](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I recently finished my MS in Statistics at the University of Pittsburgh, where I worked under the supervision of Lucas Mentch. I am most interested in creating inferential procedures for machine learning modeling methods, as well as developing accessible statistical tools that are applicable to natural and social science research. 

Currently, I am working on a model selection paper with [Lucas Mentch](http://lucasmentch.com/index.html), a sleep study with some collaborators at the University of Pittsburgh Center for Sleep and Circadian Science [(CSCS)](https://www.sleep.pitt.edu/), and I'm beginnning my advanced data analysis project on crater detection under the supervision [Max G'sell](http://stat.cmu.edu/people/faculty/mgsell).
