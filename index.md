Hi! I am a second year PhD student in the [Department of Statistics & Data Science](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I am primarily interested in developing methods for generating model confidence sets. More broadly, I am interested in creating inferential procedures for machine learning modeling methods, as well as developing accessible statistical tools that are applicable to natural and social science research. 

I recently finished a model set selection paper with [Lucas Mentch](http://lucasmentch.com/index.html) and I'm currently completing my advanced data analysis project on crater detection under the supervision [Max G'Sell](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/mgsell/). Additionally, I am a member of the Study Design and Analysis in Psychiatry group in the Psychiatry Department at Pitt.

# Reading

I'm keeping a running list of papers that I'm currently reading (or want to read) so that I don't have hundreds of tabs open on my internet browser all of the time.

* [Cross validation with confidence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.07904.pdf)
* [Model confidence bounds for variable selection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.09509.pdf)
* [You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640v5.pdf)

[Here](pages/reading.md) is a more comprehensive list.
