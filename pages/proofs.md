In interest of helping others get quickly started reading my own work, I'll be putting some proofs here. I often find that the condensed proofs that get published in papers are difficult to read. I understand that it's good practice to modularize proofs, however, I find it difficult to continually jump forward to Lemma A.12.4.52.1 and Lemma D.6.1.1.1 in order to understand what's going on. 

Therefore, I will populate this page with some of my own notes. Proofs will be written in a more linear fashion, introducing lemmas as needed (to be then referenced later). Hopefully others will find this useful.

I will be putting some proof details here...
